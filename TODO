...this is the original file - keeping it just for reference - not up to date
really... ;-)


For 0.4.0
---------

- Add reason to save_records (SIGTERM/SIGHUP==reboot, none==CRASH??)
  - Include option to send e-mail directly after reboot if uptimed wasn't
    shut down properly (no mail on scheduled reboots, only for crashes)
    (cap)
- Write ncurses uprecords and split uprecords into uprecords.cgi and ncurses
  uprecords if necessary
- configurable layout (ability to make the headers centered)

For 0.5.0
---------

- Optional KNotify support (cap)
  dcop knotify '' notify maximize kwin "new record" -1 -1 -1 -1
  (requires changes in dcop server first, see
  http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-core-devel&m=100783153324488&w=2)
- Include KDE panel applet GUI (cap)
- Cool Gnome/WM progs that play a happy sound or pop-up when breaking the
  record or reaching a milestone. Contributions in this area would be very
  much appreciated.

For 0.x.0
---------

- More portability? (BSD, Solaris, Windoze??)
- Networking, kinda like rwhod. Uptimed broadcasts to localnet
  (configurable??) and listens as well. Every machine has info for the
  entire broadcast range (/var/spool/uptimed/host.records). Uprecords can be
  called/configured to list: this machine only, a specified host or all. I
  might drop this option or delay it and instead code in support for the
  www.uptimes.net project, although I do like the idea of a rwhod alike
  implementation.

For 1.0.0
---------

- Have all that included and still have the GPL as biggest file in the
  package. ;-)
